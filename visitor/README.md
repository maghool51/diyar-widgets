## ✨ Features

- **📊 Six live-feeling stat cards** — Today, Yesterday, This Week, This
  Month, Total Visits, and Online Users, each with its own icon and color
  role.
- **🎨 Material Design 3 visuals** — role-based color tokens, soft elevation
  shadows, glassmorphism surfaces, rounded corners at every scale, and
  professional, breathable spacing.
- **🌗 Light / Dark / Auto theming** — automatically detects and follows the
  browser's `prefers-color-scheme`, persists explicit user choices, and
  cross-fades smoothly between themes.
- **🕋 Native RTL & Persian typography** — right-to-left layout, the
  [Vazirmatn](https://github.com/rastikerdar/vazirmatn) typeface, and full
  Persian (Farsi) UI copy out of the box.
- **🔢 Persian digit formatting** — a reusable `toPersianDigits()` helper
  converts numbers like `184352` into `۱۸۴٬۳۵۲` with correct thousands
  separators.
- **🎬 Rich, tasteful motion** — animated counters (ease-out roll-up),
  staggered fade/slide/scale card entrances, Material ripple feedback,
  shimmering loading skeletons, and hover micro-interactions.
- **⚡ Zero dependencies, zero build step** — pure ES2023 vanilla
  JavaScript loaded as plain `<script>` tags. No React, no Vue, no
  Bootstrap, no Tailwind, no jQuery.
- **🧩 Clean, swappable data layer** — reads real data from `stats.json`
  with automatic retries and graceful fallback, architected so swapping in
  a live backend later is a one-function change (see
  [Data Layer & Future Backends](#-data-layer--future-backends)).
- **🔗 Single-tag embed** — `embed.js` turns the whole widget into one
  `<script>` tag for third-party pages, Blogfa included, with automatic
  duplicate-load protection and support for multiple widgets per page.
- **♿ Accessible by default** — semantic landmarks, ARIA roles/labels,
  full keyboard support, visible focus states, a polite live region for
  updates, `prefers-reduced-motion` support, and `forced-colors` compatibility.
- **📱 Fully responsive** — tuned breakpoints for mobile phones, folded and
  unfolded foldables, tablets, laptops, and large/ultra-wide monitors.

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1 — Single-tag embed (Blogfa, plain HTML, any third-party page)

The simplest way to add the widget to any page you don't control the
`<head>` of — including Blogfa templates:

```html
<script src="https://maghool51.github.io/diyar-widgets/visitor/embed.js"></script>
```

Drop that one tag anywhere in your page's body and a widget instance
renders exactly there. `embed.js` automatically:

- creates its own mount container at that exact position in the page,
- loads `visitor.css` and the icon sprite once, no matter how many times
  the tag appears on the page,
- loads `config.js` → `utils.js` → `theme.js` → `animations.js` →
  `visitor.js` in the correct order,
- resolves `stats.json` to an absolute URL so it works correctly even
  though the page is hosted somewhere else entirely,
- supports multiple widgets on one page — just repeat the tag wherever
  you want another instance.

### Option 2 — Copy the folder (full control over markup)

Copy the `visitor/` directory into your project and reference the files
directly:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="visitor/visitor.css" />

<div id="diyar-visitor-widget"></div>

<script src="visitor/config.js"></script>
<script src="visitor/utils.js"></script>
<script src="visitor/theme.js"></script>
<script src="visitor/animations.js"></script>
<script src="visitor/visitor.js"></script>
```

### Option 3 — Clone the monorepo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maghool51/diyar-widgets.git
cd diyar-widgets/visitor
npm run serve
```

`npm run serve` starts a static file server (via `serve`) at
`http://localhost:5050` — no build step, no bundling, no compilation.

### Option 4 — npm package

```bash
npm install @diyar-widgets/visitor
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

The widget auto-mounts on `DOMContentLoaded` into every element matching
any of three conventions, so more than one widget can coexist on a single
page:

```html
<!-- Legacy single-widget convention (still fully supported) -->
<div id="diyar-visitor-widget"></div>

<!-- Attribute convention — preferred for multiple widgets -->
<div data-diyar-widget></div>
<div data-diyar-widget></div>

<!-- Class convention — equivalent to the attribute convention -->
<div class="diyar-visitor-widget"></div>
```

The default id-based selector is configurable via `config.js` →
`MOUNT_SELECTOR`; the attribute and class conventions are always active
alongside it.

### Programmatic control

Every mounted instance is also reachable through the public `DiyarVisitor`
API for cases where you need manual control (e.g. a single-page app that
mounts the widget after a route change):

```js
// Mount manually into any element, selector, NodeList, or array of elements
const instance = DiyarVisitor.mount('#my-custom-container');

// Mounting more than one element at once returns an array of instances
const instances = DiyarVisitor.mount(document.querySelectorAll('.my-widgets'));

// Force an immediate data refresh
await instance.refresh();

// Switch the theme programmatically
instance.setTheme('dark'); // 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto'

// Tear down timers, listeners, and rendered markup entirely
instance.destroy();
```

Auto-mounted instances are also exposed as `window.DiyarVisitorInstances`
(an array, one entry per matched element on the page). Calling `mount()`
again on an element that already has a live instance returns that same
instance rather than creating a duplicate.

## 🎛️ Customization

All tunables live in **one file — `config.js`** — so the rest of the
codebase never needs to be touched for everyday customization:

| Key                | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VERSION`          | Semantic version, surfaced in the footer & console banner.       |
| `CACHE_TIME`       | How long (ms) fetched data is considered fresh.                  |
| `UPDATE_INTERVAL`  | Background polling interval (ms).                                |
| `DEBUG`            | Enables verbose, namespaced console logging.                     |
| `ANIMATION_SPEED`  | Object of durations for counters, entrances, theme fades, ripples, and skeleton shimmer. |
| `THEME`            | Default mode (`'light' \| 'dark' \| 'auto'`) and storage key.    |
| `DATA_URL`         | Location of `stats.json` — the single place that hardcodes it.  |
| `API_TIMEOUT`      | Timeout (ms) before a `stats.json` request is aborted.           |
| `API_RETRY_COUNT`  | Additional retry attempts after a failed request, before falling back. |
| `API_ENDPOINT`     | Reserved for a future live backend endpoint (not yet consumed).  |
| `DEFAULT_DATA`     | The fallback statistics object rendered if `stats.json` is unreachable. |
| `LOCALE` / `TIMEZONE` | Used for Persian digit + date/time formatting.                 |
| `MOUNT_SELECTOR`   | Additional CSS selector the widget auto-mounts into (alongside the always-active `[data-diyar-widget]`/`.diyar-visitor-widget` conventions). |

### Re-theming

Every color, radius, blur, and font in `visitor.css` is a CSS custom
property declared under `.diyar-visitor` (light) and
`.diyar-visitor[data-diyar-theme='dark']` (dark) — deliberately **not**
`:root`, so the widget's styling can never leak onto the page it's
embedded in (see [`embed.js`](#-installation) above). Override any subset
by targeting the same mount element in your own stylesheet, loaded after
`visitor.css`:

```css
#diyar-visitor-widget {
  --diyar-primary: #ff6b6b;
  --diyar-radius-lg: 16px;
}
```

### Changing labels or adding a stat card

Card definitions live in a single declarative array (`STAT_DEFINITIONS`)
inside `visitor.js`. Add, remove, or relabel a card by editing one array
entry — the markup, entrance animation, and counter wiring all key off it
automatically:

```js
{ key: 'today', label: 'امروز', icon: 'icon-eye', tone: 'primary' }
```

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

This file describes `visitor/` itself — everything GitHub Pages actually
serves. As of v1.3.0, the repository also has two sibling folders at its
root (`worker/` and `.github/workflows/`) that implement the real-time
data backend described above; they're deployed separately and are not
part of what GitHub Pages publishes. See
[Deploying the real-time backend](#deploying-the-real-time-backend).

**Module responsibilities at a glance:**

- `config.js` — every constant; nothing elsewhere hard-codes a number.
- `utils.js` — pure formatting helpers **and** the data layer
  (`fetchVisitorStats`), the only place that knows where numbers come from.
- `theme.js` — resolves `light`/`dark`/`auto`, persists the choice, and
  reacts live to OS-level theme changes.
- `animations.js` — a tiny animation toolkit (counters, staggered
  entrances, ripples, skeleton toggling) with no DOM-building of its own.
- `visitor.js` — the only module that builds/mutates the widget's DOM; it
  composes the three subsystems above into a mountable instance.
- `embed.js` — a standalone loader; not part of the module chain above,
  it exists purely to fetch and wire up the other five scripts on a page
  that only wants to add one `<script>` tag.
- `visitor.css` / `demo.css` — kept as two separate files on purpose: the
  former is safe to load on any third-party page, the latter is not.

---

## 🔌 Data Layer & Real-Time Backend

The widget's data source is **`stats.json`**, fetched by `utils.js`'s
`fetchVisitorStats()` from the URL in `config.DATA_URL` (defaults to
`./stats.json`, resolved automatically to an absolute URL when loaded via
`embed.js` on a third-party page). It supports either a flat or a
versioned/nested schema (both are auto-detected — see the schema
documentation at the top of `utils.js`), retries automatically on failure
(`config.API_RETRY_COUNT`), and falls back to the last successfully cached
snapshot — or to `DEFAULT_DATA` if nothing has ever loaded — if every
attempt fails. See [Customization](#-customization) for related config keys.

**As of v1.3.0, `stats.json` is populated with real, deduplicated visit
data** — not a static demo file — by two components that live alongside
`visitor/` in the repository but are deployed separately (`visitor.js`
and every other widget file are completely unaware of any of this; they
only ever see the resulting JSON file):

- **`worker/`** — a Cloudflare Worker that records one privacy-respecting,
  deduplicated visit per visitor per day (`POST /hit`, called by
  `embed.js`'s beacon) and exposes an authenticated aggregate-stats
  endpoint (`GET /aggregate`).
- **`.github/workflows/publish-stats.yml`** — a scheduled GitHub Actions
  workflow that reads that aggregate and commits it to
  `visitor/stats.json`, which GitHub Pages then serves exactly as before.

### Deploying the real-time backend

1. **Create the Worker's database:**
   ```bash
   cd worker
   wrangler d1 create diyar_visitor_db
   ```
   Copy the `database_id` it prints into `worker/wrangler.toml`.

2. **Load the schema:**
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 execute diyar_visitor_db --remote --file=./schema.sql
   ```

3. **Set the publish secret** (any long random string — this is what
   authenticates the GitHub Actions workflow to the Worker's
   `/aggregate` endpoint):
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put PUBLISH_SECRET
   ```

4. **Deploy the Worker:**
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```
   Note the URL it prints, e.g.
   `https://diyar-visitor-tracker.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

5. **Point `embed.js` at your Worker:** open `visitor/embed.js` and
   replace the `TRACK_ENDPOINT` placeholder near the top of the file with
   `https://<your-worker-url>/hit`, then commit and push.

6. **Add two GitHub Actions secrets** (repository Settings → Secrets and
   variables → Actions):
   - `DIYAR_WORKER_URL` — your Worker's base URL (no trailing slash, no `/hit`).
   - `DIYAR_PUBLISH_SECRET` — the exact same value you set in step 3.

7. **Done.** The `publish-stats.yml` workflow starts running on its own
   schedule (every ~10 minutes); you can also trigger it manually from
   the Actions tab to verify it immediately.

**Planned for future releases:**

- [ ] Historical trend sparkline per card, backed by the same D1 data.
- [ ] Pluggable data adapters (REST, GraphQL, Firebase) as an alternative to the Worker.
- [ ] Multi-language copy (English / Arabic) alongside the Persian default.
- [ ] A CLI scaffolding tool for generating new `diyar-widgets` packages.

## 🌐 Browser Support

| Browser              | Supported |
| --------------------- | :-------: |
| Chrome / Edge (latest 2) | ✅ |
| Firefox (latest 2)       | ✅ |
| Safari (latest 2)        | ✅ |
| Opera (latest 2)         | ✅ |
| iOS Safari / Chrome Android | ✅ |
| Internet Explorer 11     | ❌ |

The widget relies on standard, well-supported modern web platform features:
CSS custom properties, `backdrop-filter`, `Intl.DateTimeFormat`,
`matchMedia`, and `requestAnimationFrame`. No polyfills are bundled.

---

## ♿ Accessibility

- Landmark region (`role="region"`) with a descriptive `aria-label`.
- Every stat card is a semantic list item (`role="listitem"`) inside an
  `role="list"` container.
- Loading state is announced via `aria-busy`, and a polite `aria-live`
  region announces successful/failed refreshes.
- Theme toggle and refresh controls are real `<button>` elements with
  descriptive `aria-label`s, full keyboard operability, and visible
  `:focus-visible` outlines.
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (animations resolve instantly rather
  than being skipped, so no information is lost) and `forced-colors` (high
  contrast mode).

## 🛠️ Code Quality

- **Strict mode & ES2023** across every script.
- **Modular architecture** — five single-responsibility modules
  (`config`, `utils`, `theme`, `animations`, `visitor`) composed by one
  controller, plus a sixth, standalone loader (`embed.js`) for single-tag
  third-party embedding, with no circular dependencies.
- **Zero framework, zero build step** — works by dropping `<script>` tags
  into any HTML page, static site generator, CMS, or server-rendered app.
- **Professional inline documentation** — every exported function carries
  a JSDoc block describing its contract.
- **No TODOs, no placeholders, no dead code.**

## 🤝 Contribution Guide

Contributions are welcome! To propose a change:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch:
   `git checkout -b feature/my-improvement`
2. Keep the zero-dependency, zero-build philosophy intact — new code
   should still run as plain `<script>` tags.
3. Match the existing code style: strict mode, JSDoc on every exported
   function, and CSS custom properties for anything themeable.
4. Run `npm run format` before committing.
5. Open a pull request against `maghool51/diyar-widgets` describing
   the motivation and behavior of your change.
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under an `[Unreleased]` heading.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome via GitHub Issues.
